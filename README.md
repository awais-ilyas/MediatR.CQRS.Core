# Introduction
This project aims to provide a quick implementation of CQRS using MediatoR in ASP.NET Core.


# CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
This is a design pattern or development practice that allows you to separate your create/update operations (we call it — Commands) from your reads (we call it — Queries) each returning their response models for clear segregation of each action.

# MediatoR
1. Helps us to solve the following problems:
2. Reducing the number of connections between classes.
3. Encapsulation of objects using the mediator interface.
4. Providing a unified interface to managing dependencies between classes.
